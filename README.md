# FYS3150

## Aim 
The Aim of this project is to get familiar with various vector and matrix operations from dynamic memory allocation to the usage of programs in the library package of the course. A oen dimensional Poisson equation was solved through the use of a self implemented and optimized tridiagonal matrix algorith and a LU decomposition from the armadillo repository.
